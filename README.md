FeaturedRecyclerView
------------------------------
**FeaturedRecyclerView** is a custom **ViewGroup** which is made by extending **ReyclerView**. As name suggest **FeaturedRecyclerView**, it features the first item which is at top (by setting its height to **featuredItemHeight**).

[![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-11%2B-red.svg)](https://android-arsenal.com/api?level=11) [![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-FeaturedRecyclerView-yellowgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/5892)

I have written article on this library (How's it working)

Attributes
----------

* **featuredItemHeight**: Height of first item.
* **defaultItemHeight** : Height of other items.
* **offset** : It is not a xml attribute but a parameter which is received in **FeaturedRecyclerViewAdapter**'s method to animate the property of childs widget.

FutureWork
---------------
* **Horizontal Orientation** support would be added.
* **Reference Points** would be changed.

Basic Usage
-----------

Add below lines in build.gradle at app level.
```java
compile 'com.github.developer-shivam:FeaturedRecyclerView:1.0.0'
```

*For a working implementation, see `/app` folder*

```java
FeaturedRecyclerView featuredRecyclerView = (FeaturedRecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.featured_recycler_view);
FeatureLinearLayoutManager layoutManager = new FeatureLinearLayoutManager(this);
featuredRecyclerView.setLayoutManager(layoutManager);
CustomRecyclerViewAdapter adapter = new CustomRecyclerViewAdapter(this, dummyData);featuredRecyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
```

You must use **FeaturedLinearLayoutManager** to avoid flickering.

```xml
<developer.shivam.featuredrecyclerview.FeaturedRecyclerView android:id="@+id/featured_recycler_view"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:featuredItemHeight="400dp"
    android:defaultItemHeight="200dp" />
```

Adavantages of using **FeaturedRecyclerViewAdapter** is that it contains two more methods which can be used to animate the properties of childs attribute (like textView fading).

```java
    @Override
    public void onSmallItemResize(CustomRecyclerViewHolder holder, int position, float offset) {
       holder.tvHeading.setAlpha(offset / 100f);
    }

    @Override
    public void onBigItemResize(CustomRecyclerViewHolder holder, int position, float offset) {
       holder.tvHeading.setAlpha(offset / 100f);
    }
```
